Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project dedicated to predicting customer churn and analyzing trends within the e-commerce sector. The goal is to help businesses identify customers at risk of leaving, understand the factors driving churn, and implement proactive strategies to improve customer retention.

Key objectives include:

- Developing predictive models for customer churn.

- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.

- Creating actionable visualizations for business decision-making.

Data Sources

The project uses anonymized e-commerce customer data containing features such as transaction history, demographics, and engagement metrics. Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction.

Workflow
The project follows a structured workflow:

1- Data Collection & Preprocessing: Validate, clean, and format raw data.

2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze trends and patterns in customer behavior.

3- Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features and select important variables.

4- Model Development: Train baseline and advanced machine learning models.

5- Deployment: Containerize the model, deploy it to the cloud, and set up monitoring dashboards.
